Many investors are not conscious of the uniqueness of 2021 and 2022 from a cycle perspective and thus keep the capacity in the hope of a return/rebound.,(s12) This is a derivate of the political instability and global tensions. The insecurity has a direct impact on oil prices  and bunker remains the single largest cost item in liner shipping.,(s17) We are only at generation one of the CO2 neutral vessel designs  the evolution here is decisive for the life-span of the vessel investments  and when to order the next  and it becomes decisive for the scrapping of the traditional vessels.,(s19) With the current market outlook  we expect the overcapacity to create a window of yard capacity of e.g. retrofits.,6/11/2023 @ 9:06:36,2,8,9,not required,Q-Sort Maritime Study,728aa3ee-d43,-1|0|-1|0|1|1|-1|1|1|2|0|2|-1|0|0|0|-2|0|-2,00:00:21,00:06:10,00:01:21,00:03:13,no data,-1,0,-1,0,1,1,-1,1,1,2,0,2,-1,0,0,0,-2,0,-2

Fuel prices as we know depend on many factors especially geopolitical which cannot be resolved by maritime sector alone. So it is not an efficient choice to focus on in the short term,(s19) Shipyard availability is not area of expertise however from the knowledge of transport and port geography that I have  I do not agree that these constraints can be efficiently resolved in the short term as there are strategic considerations involved in onboarding new and better maritime artifacts to address the environmental aspects of old builds.
